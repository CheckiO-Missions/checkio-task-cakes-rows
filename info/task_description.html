    <p>"We must burn the house down!" said the Rabbit's voice; and
        Alice called out as loud as she could, "If you do. I'll set
        Dinah at you!"</p>

    <p>There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to
        herself, "I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any
        sense, they'd take the roof off." After a minute or two, they
        began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, "A
        barrowful will do, to begin with."</p>

    <p>
        "A barrowful of WHAT? thought Alice; but she had not long to
        doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came
        rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.
        "Ill put a stop to this, she said to herself, and shouted out,
        "You'd better not do that again! which produced another dead
        silence.</p>

    <p>
        Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all
        turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright
        idea came into her head. "If I eat one of these cakes, she
        thought, "its sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it
        cant possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I
        suppose.

<p>
    The cakes are laying on the floor, and all cakes are round.
    Our robots can't help but try to figure out a pattern behind the cakes' disposition.
    Some cakes form rows and we want to count these rows.
    A row is a sequence of three or more cakes if we can draw a straight line through its centers.
    The greater row takes up the smaller rows. So if we have a row with 4 cakes,
    then we have only one row (not 4 by 3).
</p>

<p>
    The cakes' location is represented as a list of coordinates. A coordinate is a list of two integers.
    You should count the rows.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is an example of the image recognition. If to be more careful -- it's the pattern recognition.
    This concept can be useful for the game mechanics or if you want to write a bot for games.
